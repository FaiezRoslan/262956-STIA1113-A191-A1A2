# Introduction
This assigment are all about how to write and run a java program. This assignment had give me a clear idea about how to create a java program starting with pseudocode and the flow chart of the program. I had applied all what i have learn in class to complete this assignment.



# Pseudocode
Start
    Output "Car Price (RM): "
    Input car price
    Looping the input of car price if car price is less than RM30,000
    Output "Down Payment (RM): "
    Input down payment
    Lopping the input of downpayment if downpayment in negative number
    Output " Loan Period (Years): "
    Input loan period
    Looping loan period if loan period is below than 0 and not in range between 5 years to 7 years 
    Output "Interest Rate (%):"
    Input interest rate
    Lopping the interest rate output if below than  3% and more than 7%
    Calculate total interest = (car price - down payment) * interest rate / 100 * loan period
    Calculate monthly repayment = (car price - down payment + total interest) / (loan period * 12)
    Output monthly repayment
    Looping depending on loan period
       Calculate years = n  year
       Calculate principal = monthly repayment * 12 * n year
       Calculate interest = total interest/loan period * n year
       Calculate balance = monthly repayment * 12 * (loan period - n year)  
       years, principal, interest, balance is stored in array   
       Output is years, principal, interest, balance
End
